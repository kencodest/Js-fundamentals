JSON.parse() - Converts from string to an array or to whatever it was before. E.g `2` becomes 2, which is a number (int in Js), `["hello]` becomes ["hello"], which is an array. //when they talk about parsing a string, that's what they mean.


To convert any type to a string again, we use JSON.stringify(#the value)
